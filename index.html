  <h1>About Sally</h1>
  <p>Sally is a coastal-inspired artist based in the UK, passionate about transforming the natural beauty of sea shells into decorative art. With a deep appreciation for shoreline textures, colour, and organic form, Sally blends artistic detail with seaside charm to create uniquely handcrafted pieces.</p>

  <p>Her process begins with responsibly sourced oyster and scallop shells, each one hand-cleaned and prepared for design. Sally uses a combination of decoupage, hand-painting, and soft acrylic finishes to enhance the shell’s natural structure — bringing out its story while adding a layer of creativity and warmth.</p>

  <p>Each shell is made in small batches from her home studio. No two pieces are ever alike. She often finds inspiration in coastal landscapes, vintage patterns, and classic nautical themes, resulting in work that is both timeless and personal. Many of her designs are ideal for gifts, keepsakes, or simply adding a tranquil coastal touch to the home.</p>

  <p>Sally’s work has caught the eye of small blog features, handmade marketplaces, and shell collectors who value quality craftsmanship and design with meaning.</p>
